# Assignment5
This project contains two basic Python programs designed for beginners.

Task 1 focuses on using a dictionary to store student names and their marks. The program asks the user to enter a student’s name and then displays the marks if the name is found in the dictionary. If the student’s name is not found, it shows a message saying the student is not in the records. This task helps in understanding how to work with dictionaries and perform basic lookups.

Task 2 demonstrates list slicing in Python. It creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, extracts the first five numbers, reverses them, and prints both the original sliced list and the reversed list. This helps in learning how to use slicing and reverse operations in lists.
